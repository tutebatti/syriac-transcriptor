# syriac-transcriptor
A simple html file with JavaScript to convert Syriac to Latin transcription and vice versa 

## Idea

The "program" is portable to different systems because it is a simple html file. The JavaScript is executed on the local system.

There are three different transcription systems available:

- one that is [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection); it will be less intuitive at first for Syriac scholars but guarantees transliteration in both directions without loss of information
- one for Eastern and one for Western vowels

Text passages in the Syriac or Latin can be selected and will be highlighted in both the Syriac and Latin. Also, the passages are displayed in the log output.

## To do

- Check browser compatibility
- Improve transcription regarding Latin input (problem of accents with English keyboard layout)
- Improve documentation
